This is a simple script written in Python that allows the user to scan a given IP address.
Program has been tested to run in MS VS Code. May require adjustments to run in another development environment. 
Simply enter in the IP addres for the host you wish to scan and it will quickly respond with any open ports on that host. 

This is useful in that attackers often search for open ports on network-connected hosts. 
If you have no other tools with you and simply want a quick scan on open ports, this can serve to provide those easily. 

Great also if you need to scan something quickly for compliance and for penetration testing purposes.
